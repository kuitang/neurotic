abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, local circuits consist of tens of thousands of neurons, each of which makes thousands of synaptic connections. Perhaps the biggest impediment to understanding these networks is that we have no wiring diagrams of their interconnections. Even if we had a partial or complete wiring diagram, however, understanding the network would also require information about each neuron's function. Here we show that the relationship between structure and function can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize a functional property--the preferred stimulus orientation--of a group of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion of these neurons' local network. Consistent with a prediction from recent physiological experiments, inhibitory interneurons received convergent anatomical input from nearby excitatory neurons with a broad range of preferred orientations, although weak biases could not be rejected.},

abstract = {The structure and connectivity of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been deduced from reconstructions of electron micrographs of serial sections. The hermaphrodite nervous system has a total complement of 302 neurons, which are arranged in an essentially invariant structure. Neurons with similar morphologies and connectivities have been grouped together into classes; there are 118 such classes. Neurons have simple morphologies with few, if any, branches. Processes from neurons run in defined positions within bundles of parallel processes, synaptic connections being made en passant. Process bundles are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected, making synaptic connections with many of their neighbours. Muscle cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside. Most of the morphologically identifiable synaptic connections in a typical animal are described. These consist of about 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 neuromuscular junctions and 600 gap junctions.},

"There are 302 neurons in the nervous system of C. elegans; this number is invariant between animals. Each neuron has a unique combination of properties, such as morphology, connectivity and position, so that every neuron may be given a unique label. Groups of neurons that differ from each other only in position have been assigned to classes. There are 118 classes that have been made using these criteria, the class sizes ranging from 1 to 13. Thus C. elegans has a rich variety of neuron types in spite of having only a small total complement of neurons. This is in marked contrast to structures such as the mammalian cerebellum, which contains more than 1010 neurons (Braitenberg \& Atwood 1958) and yet has only five classes of component neuron (Eccles et al. 1967)."
        
"Small groups of processes were given arbitrary labels, which were written onto the prints with Rotring drafting pens. These labels were carried through all the pictures in which the associated processes were present, and this procedure was repeated until all process profiles were labelled. Processes could then be joined to other processes where branches had occurred, or ultimately be assigned to particular neurons if their cell bodies were within the scope of the reconstruction. When all the labelling was completed, each process was individually followed through every section in which it appeared, and a list was compiled of all the synaptic contacts that it made. In this way all synaptic contacts were recorded twice, once for each member of an interacting pair of processes. This provided a useful check on synapse scoring as any synaptic contact that was only scored once was reappraised.."
        
"A long series that overlapped at both ends, designated N2Y, was obtained from a male animal (Sulston et al. 1980, in which it was referred to as series 4). The motoneurons of the ventral cord and the cells from the posterior lateral ganglion were reconstructed from this animal. The motoneurons (with the exception of the sex-specific VCn class) exhibited essentially the same synaptic behaviour as their anterior counterparts in the hermaphrodite."
