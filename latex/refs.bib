@article{Bock2011,
abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, local circuits consist of tens of thousands of neurons, each of which makes thousands of synaptic connections. Perhaps the biggest impediment to understanding these networks is that we have no wiring diagrams of their interconnections. Even if we had a partial or complete wiring diagram, however, understanding the network would also require information about each neuron's function. Here we show that the relationship between structure and function can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize a functional property--the preferred stimulus orientation--of a group of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion of these neurons' local network. Consistent with a prediction from recent physiological experiments, inhibitory interneurons received convergent anatomical input from nearby excitatory neurons with a broad range of preferred orientations, although weak biases could not be rejected.},

Reconstructions of large volumes of neural tissue, necessary to reconstruct even local neural circuits, have, however, been inhibited by the daunting task of serially sectioning and reconstructing thousands of sections. Recent technological developments have improved the quality of volume electron microscopy data and automated its acquisition. This opens up the prospect of reconstructing almost complete invertebrate and sizable fractions of vertebrate nervous systems. Such reconstructions of complete neural wiring diagrams could rekindle the tradition of relating neural function to the underlying neuroanatomical circuitry.},

abstract = {The watershed transform has interesting properties that make it useful for many different image segmentation applications: it is simple and intuitive, can be parallelized, and always produces a complete division of the image. However, when applied to medical image analysis, it has important drawbacks (oversegmentation, sensitivity to noise, poor detection of thin or low signal to noise ratio structures). We present an improvement to the watershed transform that enables the introduction of prior information in its calculation. We propose to introduce this information via the use of a previous probability calculation. Furthermore, we introduce a method to combine the watershed transform and atlas registration, through the use of markers. We have applied our new algorithm to two challenging applications: knee cartilage and gray matter/white matter segmentation in MR images. Numerical validation of the results is provided, demonstrating the strength of the algorithm for medical image segmentation.},

abstract = {Connections between neurons can be found by checking whether synapses exist at points of contact, which in turn are determined by neural shapes. Finding these shapes is a special case of image segmentation, which is laborious for humans and would ideally be performed by computers. New metrics properly quantify the performance of a computer algorithm using its disagreement with 'true' segmentations of example images. New machine learning methods search for segmentation algorithms that minimize such metrics. These advances have reduced computer errors dramatically. It should now be faster for a human to correct the remaining errors than to segment an image manually. Further reductions in human effort are expected, and crucial for finding connectomes more complex than that of Caenorhabditis elegans.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: We propose a beta-mixture model approach to solve a variety of problems related to correlations of gene-expression levels. For example, in meta-analyses of microarray gene-expression datasets, a threshold value of correlation coefficients for gene-expression levels is used to decide whether gene-expression levels are strongly correlated across studies. Ad hoc threshold values such as 0.5 are often used. In this paper, we use a beta-mixture model approach to divide the correlation coefficients into several populations so that the large correlation coefficients can be identified. Another important application of the proposed method is in finding co-expressed genes. Two examples are provided to illustrate both applications. Through our analysis, we also discover that the popular model selection criteria BIC and AIC are not suitable for the beta-mixture model. To determine the number of components in the mixture model, we suggest an alternative criterion, ICL-BIC, which is shown to perform better in selecting the correct mixture model.

abstract = {While there has been substantial progress in segmenting natural images, state-of-the-art methods that perform well in such tasks unfortunately tend to underperform when confronted with the different challenges posed by electron microscope (EM) data. For example, in EM imagery of neural tissue, numerous cells and subcellular structures appear within a single image, they exhibit irregular shapes that cannot be easily modeled by standard techniques, and confusing textures clutter the background. We propose a fully automated approach that handles these challenges by using sophisticated cues that capture global shape and texture information, and by learning the specific appearance of object boundaries. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and closely matches the performance of human annotators.},

abstract = {We describe an approach for automation of the process of reconstruction of neural tissue from serial section transmission electron micrographs. Such reconstructions require 3D segmentation of individual neuronal processes (axons and dendrites) performed in densely packed neuropil. We first detect neuronal cell profiles in each image in a stack of serial micrographs with multi-scale ridge detector. Short breaks in detected boundaries are interpolated using anisotropic contour completion formulated in fuzzy-logic framework. Detected profiles from adjacent sections are linked together based on cues such as shape similarity and image texture. Thus obtained 3D segmentation is validated by human operators in computer-guided proofreading process. Our approach makes possible reconstructions of neural tissue at final rate of about 5 microm3/manh, as determined primarily by the speed of proofreading. To date we have applied this approach to reconstruct few blocks of neural tissue from different regions of rat brain totaling over 1000microm3, and used these to evaluate reconstruction speed, quality, error rates, and presence of ambiguous locations in neuropil ssTEM imaging data.},

Three types of non-redundant samplings, random, hybrid (perturbed deterministic) and deterministic (spiral) are shown to provide completeness of the resulting sampled Zernike polynomial expansion. When completeness is guaranteed, then we can obtain an orthonormal basis, and hence the inversion only requires transposition of the matrix formed by the basis vectors (modes). The discrete Zernike modes are given for different sampling patterns and number of samples. The DZT has been implemented showing better performance, numerical stability and robustness than the standard Zernike expansion in numerical simulations. Non-redundant (critical) sampling along with an invertible transformation can be useful in a wide variety of applications.},

Our method takes advantage of sparse scribble annotations provided by the user to guide a 3D variational segmentation model, thereby allowing our method to globally optimally enforce 3D geometric constraints on the segmentation. Moreover, we leverage a novel algorithm for propagating segmentation constraints through the image stack via optimal volumetric pathways, thereby allowing our method to compute highly accurate 3D segmentations from very sparse user input. We evaluate our method by reconstructing 16 neural processes in a 1024 x 1024 x 50 nanometer-scale EM image stack of a mouse hippocampus. We demonstrate that, on average, our method is 68\% more accurate than previous state-of-the-art semi-automatic methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate material classification from single images obtained under unknown viewpoint and illumination. It is demonstrated that materials can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods (starting from as small as 3 $\backslash$times 3 pixels square) and that this can outperform classification using filter banks with large support. It is also shown that the performance of filter banks is inferior to that of image patches with equivalent neighborhoods. We develop novel texton-based representations which are suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution for Markov random fields. The representations are learned from training images and then used to classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. Three such representations are proposed and their performance is assessed and compared to that of filter banks. The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying 2,806 images of all 61 materials present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank-based classifiers such as Leung and Malik (IJCV 01), Cula and Dana (IJCV 04), and Varma and Zisserman (IJCV 05). We also benchmark performance by classifying all of the textures present in the UIUC, Microsoft Textile, and San Francisco outdoor data sets. We conclude with discussions on why features based on compact neighborhoods can correctly discriminate between textures with large global structure and why the performance of filter banks is not superior to that of the source image patches from which they were derived.},

abstract = {The structure and connectivity of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been deduced from reconstructions of electron micrographs of serial sections. The hermaphrodite nervous system has a total complement of 302 neurons, which are arranged in an essentially invariant structure. Neurons with similar morphologies and connectivities have been grouped together into classes; there are 118 such classes. Neurons have simple morphologies with few, if any, branches. Processes from neurons run in defined positions within bundles of parallel processes, synaptic connections being made en passant. Process bundles are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected, making synaptic connections with many of their neighbours. Muscle cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside. Most of the morphologically identifiable synaptic connections in a typical animal are described. These consist of about 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 neuromuscular junctions and 600 gap junctions.},
annote = {http://www.wormatlas.org/ver1/MoW\_built0.92/toc.html
        
"There are 302 neurons in the nervous system of C. elegans; this number is invariant between animals. Each neuron has a unique combination of properties, such as morphology, connectivity and position, so that every neuron may be given a unique label. Groups of neurons that differ from each other only in position have been assigned to classes. There are 118 classes that have been made using these criteria, the class sizes ranging from 1 to 13. Thus C. elegans has a rich variety of neuron types in spite of having only a small total complement of neurons. This is in marked contrast to structures such as the mammalian cerebellum, which contains more than 1010 neurons (Braitenberg \& Atwood 1958) and yet has only five classes of component neuron (Eccles et al. 1967)."
        
"Small groups of processes were given arbitrary labels, which were written onto the prints with Rotring drafting pens. These labels were carried through all the pictures in which the associated processes were present, and this procedure was repeated until all process profiles were labelled. Processes could then be joined to other processes where branches had occurred, or ultimately be assigned to particular neurons if their cell bodies were within the scope of the reconstruction. When all the labelling was completed, each process was individually followed through every section in which it appeared, and a list was compiled of all the synaptic contacts that it made. In this way all synaptic contacts were recorded twice, once for each member of an interacting pair of processes. This provided a useful check on synapse scoring as any synaptic contact that was only scored once was reappraised.."
        
"A long series that overlapped at both ends, designated N2Y, was obtained from a male animal (Sulston et al. 1980, in which it was referred to as series 4). The motoneurons of the ventral cord and the cells from the posterior lateral ganglion were reconstructed from this animal. The motoneurons (with the exception of the sex-specific VCn class) exhibited essentially the same synaptic behaviour as their anterior counterparts in the hermaphrodite."
